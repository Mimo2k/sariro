## Key Architecture

### Auth (Supabase)
- **AuthProvider** is in `src/app/layout.tsx` (root layout) — wraps entire app
- **Profile type** includes: `is_student`, `is_teacher`, `is_admin`, `is_super_admin`
- **`getRole(profile)`** function returns highest-priority role: super_admin > admin > teacher > student
- **Auth flow**: Login → `/auth/callback` → `/dashboard` → role router → correct dashboard
- **Profile completion modal**: Asks for missing name/phone/email based on provider
- **Sign-in page**: Blue theme, "Welcome back"
- **Sign-up page**: Violet+amber theme, "Become a Sariro builder" + benefit cards
- **Google One Tap**: Loads GIS script, exchanges ID token with Supabase
- **GitHub OAuth**: `signInWithOAuth({provider:'github'})`
- **Email/Password**: Standard Supabase `signUp` / `signInWithPassword`

### Navbar (BrandLayout)
- **AuthNavButton**: Shows "Sign in" when logged out, avatar+role badge+dropdown when logged in
  - Role badge: Student (blue), Teacher (green), Admin (amber), Super Admin (violet)
  - Dropdown: Dashboard link (role-based), Account settings (/settings), Sign out
- **StartLearningButton**: Only shows when NOT logged in (hidden for logged-in users)
- **Mobile sidebar**: Scrollable nav (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`), auth button pinned to bottom (`shrink-0 border-t`), body scroll locked when open

### Courses
- **TRACKS**: 10 tracks from the HTML file (web, app, saas, agent, data, cloud, design, game, automation, security)
- **COURSES**: 30 courses (10 tracks × 3 levels: Beginner $199, Intermediate $299, Advanced $699)
- **AUDIENCE_TRACKS**: Separate array for the "Three Paths" section on home (Students/Schools/Professionals)
- **Filter pills**: 4 level-based pills — All Courses / Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced (NOT track-based)
- **Flip cards**: Front=info, Back=outcomes + "Enroll now" button
- **Syllabus modal**: Opens on "Syllabus" button click, shows full module/lesson breakdown
  - z-index: `z-[70]` (above navbar)
  - Navbar HIDES when modal open (`data-syllabus-open` attribute on `<html>`)
  - Body scroll locked, only modal content scrolls
  - Close button: 44px touch target, `z-20`
  - "Enroll now" button links to `/course-path/{trackId}`

### Course Path Page (`/course-path/[id]`)
- Shows 3 level cards (Beginner green / Intermediate blue / Advanced violet)
- Click a card → auto-scrolls to details section (`detailsRef`)
- Details: outcomes + full syllabus + 1:1/1:4 batch selector
- "Reserve your seat" → opens Razorpay in new tab
- Mobile: 3 cards stack vertically (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3`)

### Checkout Page (`/checkout?course=X`)
- Shows course header + outcomes + syllabus preview
- 1:4 vs 1:1 ratio selection (blue/violet cards)
- Order summary + "Reserve your seat" → Razorpay
- Sticky checkout panel on desktop

### Pricing Page
- 1:1/1:4 dropdown selector (NOT toggle)
- 3 tier cards with prices that change based on ratio
- CTA buttons are plain `<a>` tags (NOT MagneticButton) with `relative z-10` to stay above TiltCard
- Home page pricing section also has `<a>` tags (NOT MagneticButton)

### Razorpay Payment Links
- **Single source**: `RAZORPAY_LINKS` in `sariro-data.ts`
- **`getRazorpayLink(level, ratio)`** function
- 6 links: 3 tiers × 2 ratios (1:4 and 1:1)
- 1:4 links: `sarirobeginner`, `sarirointermediate`, `sariroadvanced`
- 1:1 links: `sarirobeginner1on1`, `sarirointermediate1on1`, `sariroadvanced1on1` (PLACEHOLDERS — replace with real links)
- Also stored in Supabase `settings` table (for future super-admin dashboard editing)
- **Enroll flow**: "Enroll now" → `/course-path/{trackId}` → select level → "Reserve your seat" → Razorpay

### Team
- **Mimo Patra** — Founder and CEO (#F59E0B, isFounder)
- **Sumita Patra** — Co-Founder and CFO (#EC4899, isFounder)
- **Hasnain Ali** — Co-Founder and IT Director (#06B6D4, isFounder)

- **Marco Rossi** — Lead Mentor, LLM Applications (#2563EB)
- **Priya Nair** — Lead Mentor, Computer Vision (#7C3AED)
- **James Chen** — Career Mentor (#06B6D4)
- **Sofia Alvarez** — Community & Mentor Program (#EC4899)
- Each member has `image` field for real photos (`/images/team/{name}.jpg`)
- About page renders `<Image>` if `image` exists, falls back to letter avatar

### Emails (5 mailboxes @sariro.com)
- `contact@sariro.com` — General (Mail icon, green)
- `support@sariro.com` — Support (LifeBuoy icon, blue)
- `dev@sariro.com` — Development (Briefcase icon, violet)
- `hr@sariro.com` — Careers (Handshake icon, amber)
- `founder@sariro.com` — Founder (Sparkles icon, cyan)
- Shown on Contact page + footer Connect section

### Stat Pills (Mimo portrait)
- 4 floating pills around Mimo's portrait: 12+ Years (orange), 7 Patents (green), 5,000+ Students (blue), 36 Papers (violet)
- Mobile: 2-col grid below portrait

### Chat Bubble (SLM)
- Floating bubble bottom-right with flying entrance animation
- Keyword-based FAQ matching (28 FAQ entries)
- Body scroll lock when open
- `/api/chat` endpoint
- Chat bubble + companion orb + cookie banner hidden when any modal open (via `data-scroll-locked`)

### 3D Hero Scenes (page-hero-3d.tsx)
- 7 variants: courses, schools, events, pricing, about, resources, contact
- PricingScene (piggy bank) + AboutScene (orb) — UNTOUCHED
- ContactScene: glass envelope + orbiting bubbles + light trail
- EventsScene: floating glass event ticket + confetti
- StoryScene: open book + sparkles
- FaqScene: floating question marks + answer card
- SchoolsScene: Platonic solids + math symbols (positions use `as const` for tuples)

### Mobile Fixes
- Syllabus modal: z-[70], pt-24 on mobile, navbar hidden via `data-syllabus-open`
- Chat panel close: 44px touch target, z-[55]
- Cookie consent: z-45 (was z-9998)
- Mobile sidebar: scrollable nav, auth button pinned, body scroll locked
- Filter pills: `flex-wrap justify-center` (no horizontal scroll)
- Hero 3D: `max-w-[400px]` on mobile + `mb-16` to prevent overlap with trusted-by
- Viewport: `viewportFit: "cover"` for iOS safe-area
- All close buttons: 44px minimum, `touch-manipulation`

### Sound Fix (Cinematic Intro)
- AudioContext starts suspended on browser reload
- Sound queues on intro start, replays on first user gesture
- `soundHasPlayed` flag prevents double-play
- `pointerdown` listener for broader coverage

### TypeScript Fixes
- `about/page.tsx`: `'isFounder' in member && member.isFounder` (TEAM as const)
- `brand-layout.tsx`: EMAIL_ICONS type includes `style?: React.CSSProperties`
- `page-hero-3d.tsx`: Position arrays use `as const` for tuples
- `page-hero-3d.tsx`: `useRef<(THREE.Group | null)[]>` (was `useRef<THREE.Group>([])`)
- `footer-3d.tsx`: Same EMAIL_ICONS type fix
- `scroll-effects.tsx`: `globalThis.MouseEvent` + `as EventListener` casts

### Dashboards
- **Student**: Welcome animation, course suggestion banner, My Courses (empty state with CTA), class schedule, learning path
- **Teacher**: My Schedule (calendar), stats (classes/students/hours), student overview
- **Admin**: Stats, edit courses link, user management link
- **Super Admin**: Stats, edit courses, edit pricing, role management, payment links reference
- **Settings**: Edit name, phone, view email (read-only), save to Supabase

### SQL Schema (run in Supabase)
- `profiles` table: extends `auth.users` with `is_student`, `is_teacher`, `is_admin`, `is_super_admin`
- `enrollments` table: student ↔ course ownership
- `class_schedules` table: teacher ↔ student classes
- `faq_knowledge_base` table: 28 FAQ entries for SLM
- `unanswered_questions` table: SLM improvement loop
- `chat_conversations` + `chat_messages` tables: chat history
- `settings` table: payment links + configurable values
- RLS policies on all tables
- Triggers: `handle_new_user` (auto-create profile), `touch_updated_at`, `touch_conversation_last_message`

### .env (placeholders — replace with real keys)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

## Files NOT to touch unless explicitly needed
- All existing pages (home, courses, pricing, about, etc.) — only modify when fixing specific bugs
- All existing 3D scenes (PricingScene, AboutScene are explicitly UNTOUCHED)
- `sariro-data.ts` — only modify when adding/changing courses, team, pricing, or emails
- `WEBSITE_STATE.md` — update after every change session

## Known Working State
- Lint: clean (zero errors)
- All 20+ routes: HTTP 200
- Mobile: no horizontal overflow on any page
- Pricing buttons: all clickable, link to Razorpay
- Syllabus modal: navbar hides, body locked, only content scrolls
- Auth: redirects to `/dashboard` after login (not stuck on sign-in page)
- Filter pills: 4 level-based (All/Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), no scroll

## v1.0 Batch Management System — Added July 5, 2026

### Database (Supabase) — Additive Migration
**5 new tables** (all RLS-enabled, all with CHECK constraints):
- `cohorts` — batch of students learning same course together. State machine: `gathering → ready → active → completed`. Has `google_meet_url` (single link per cohort, never public).
- `enrollments` — student's enrollment in a course. Status: `pending | active | completed | dropped`. Has `completion_shown_at` (for upsell popup tracking).
- `bookings` — scheduled session (1 cohort + 1 teacher + time slot). Status: `scheduled | completed | cancelled | no_show`.
- `purchase_intents` — bridges Razorpay tier payment → exact course. Created before payment, confirmed by admin after.
- `admin_audit_logs` — immutable append-only log of all admin actions.

**4 new columns on `profiles`**: `role` (enum), `timezone`, `track`, `current_cohort_id`.

**15 RLS policies** total. Students see only own data; teachers see assigned cohorts; admins see all; super-admins see all + audit logs.

**13 indexes** for mobile-performance (fast queries on slow networks).

**5 triggers**: `updated_at` auto-timestamp on 4 tables + `trg_cohorts_audit` (auto-logs cohort status changes).

### Architecture — Single App, Logical Route Groups

```
src/app/
├── (public)/     ← marketing site (uses BrandLayout)
├── (auth)/       ← sign-in, sign-up (uses BrandLayout)
└── (dashboard)/  ← login-gated app (uses DashboardLayout)
```

### New Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/middleware.ts` | Gates `/dashboard/*` + `/settings`; redirects `/` → `/dashboard` when logged in. Gracefully no-ops if Supabase env vars missing. |
| `src/lib/dashboard/upsell-engine.ts` | Pure logic for next-track recommendation (Beginner→Intermediate→Advanced→next track Beginner) |
| `src/components/dashboard/upsell-popup.tsx` | Popup UI — 3 pitch variants, mobile-first bottom-sheet |
| `src/components/dashboard/global-upsell-popup.tsx` | Wrapper in root layout — fetches pending completed enrollments, renders popup on ANY page |
| `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-layout.tsx` | Own topbar + sidebar (desktop) + bottom-nav (mobile). Replaces BrandLayout for dashboard routes. |

### Modified Files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/app/layout.tsx` | Added AuthProvider + GlobalUpsellPopup (popup works on every page now) |
| `src/components/auth/auth-provider.tsx` | Profile type extended with `timezone`, `track`, `current_cohort_id`. `getRole()` prefers new `role` column. |
| `src/components/brand/brand-layout.tsx` | Removed AuthProvider wrapper (now in root layout) |
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | Added 6 models: Profile (extended), Cohort, Enrollment, Booking, PurchaseIntent, AdminAuditLog |
| `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` | Removed BrandLayout — plain loading page (middleware handles auth gate) |
| `src/app/dashboard/student/page.tsx` | Full rebuild — real enrollments, schedule, recommended next card, explore tracks |
| `src/app/dashboard/teacher/page.tsx` | Wrapped in DashboardLayout |
| `src/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx` | Wrapped in DashboardLayout |
| `src/app/dashboard/super-admin/page.tsx` | Wrapped in DashboardLayout |
| `src/app/settings/page.tsx` | Full rebuild — added timezone + track fields, "Detect" button for browser auto-fill |

### Upsell Popup Behavior
- **Trigger**: Logged-in user has enrollment with `status='completed'` AND `completion_shown_at IS NULL`
- **Shows on ANY page** (public, dashboard, settings) — lives in root layout
- **3 pitch variants** (one per completed-tier): different gradient, icon, copy
- **Track cycle**: `web → app → saas → agent → data → cloud → design → game → automation → security → web...`
- **On dismiss**: `UPDATE enrollments SET completion_shown_at = now()` — popup never shows again for that enrollment
- **Persistent card**: Student dashboard shows a "Recommended next" card based on most recent completed enrollment (even after popup dismissed)

### Dashboard Layout Structure
- **Topbar**: Sariro logo (left, links to `/`) · notification bell · avatar dropdown (role badge + name + email + sign out)
- **Sidebar (desktop ≥ lg)**: role-based nav items + "Back to website" link at bottom
- **Bottom-nav (mobile < lg)**: 4 most important items per role, iOS safe-area-aware
- **AuthGate**: shows spinner during auth load, redirects to `/auth/sign-in` if no user

### Mobile-First Priorities
- All buttons ≥ 44px touch target (Apple HIG)
- Sidebar collapses to bottom-nav on mobile (no hamburger menu needed)
- Body has `pb-20 lg:pb-0` so content doesn't hide behind bottom-nav
- Popup is full-screen bottom-sheet on mobile, centered modal on desktop
- Session times shown in user's timezone (from `profiles.timezone`)
- Viewport already has `viewportFit: "cover"` for iOS safe-area

### Security Priorities
- Middleware enforces route-level access (`/dashboard/*` requires session)
- RLS enforces row-level access (students see only own enrollments/bookings)
- `GlobalUpsellPopup` query includes `.eq('user_id', user.id)` even though RLS would enforce it (belt + suspenders)
- Audit logs are append-only (no UPDATE/DELETE policy = immutable)
- `getRole()` prefers new `role` column over legacy booleans (migration backfilled correctly)

### Quality Gates Passed (July 5, 2026)
- Lint: clean (zero errors)
- All 11 tested routes return HTTP 200: `/`, `/courses`, `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/{student,teacher,admin,super-admin}`, `/settings`, `/pricing`, `/about`, `/auth/sign-in`
- Dev server runs without errors in `dev.log`
- Graceful degradation: works without Supabase credentials (preview mode)

### Next Phase (NOT in this build)
- Teacher dashboard rebuild (real bookings + student roster)
- Admin dashboard rebuild (cohort state machine UI: gathering → ready → active → completed)
- Super-admin dashboard rebuild (pricing editor + payment-link manager + audit log viewer)
- Purchase intent flow (login gate modal → purchase_intent row → Razorpay → admin confirms → enrollment created)
- Cohort activation flow (admin "Lock Batch & Activate" → cohort.status=active, google_meet_url generated, bookings auto-created)
