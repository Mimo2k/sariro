      "Sariro is a cohort-based AI education studio founded in San Francisco by Mimo Patra. We teach AI the way real builders learn it — through live cohorts, project-first curriculum, and senior mentor feedback. Every cohort ends with a real, working AI artifact you can show an employer, client, or school. We don't sell tutorials — we ship builders.",

(2) Mentor-led, not video-led — every cohort is run by a senior builder who has shipped AI to production. (3) Project-first — every module ends with something working, not a quiz.

Sariro runs focused 4-12 week cohorts on specific AI topics (RAG, prompt engineering, computer vision, etc.), costs $199-$699 per cohort, and is designed to fit alongside your job or studies.
